# PRD: Feature 0.2 — Chatbot Interface (Core UX)

## 1. Introduction
The Chatbot Interface is the primary interaction point for the "Food is My Medicine" app. It serves as a conversational "AI Nutritionist" that integrates data from various engines (biomarker, recipe, recommendation) to provide actionable health advice.

## 2. Goals
- Provide a simple, frictionless conversational experience.
- Support multi-modal input (text, voice, image).
- Deliver complex medical/nutritional data through intuitive "Response Cards."

## 3. Functional Requirements
### 3.1 UI Components
- **Input Bar:** Supports text entry, a dedicated voice input button, and a camera/upload button.
- **Attachment Preview:** Visual feedback for uploaded lab results or food photos before sending.
- **Response Cards:** Specialized UI elements for displaying recipes, biomarker summaries, or meal plans within the chat flow.

### 3.2 Conversational Capabilities
- **Query Handling:** Must interpret intents such as "Explain my blood results," "What should I eat?", and "Improve my [biomarker]."
- **Engine Integration:** Seamlessly fetch data from the interpretation, recipe, and recommendation engines.

## 4. Technical Constraints
- Real-time message synchronization using Supabase Realtime or standard fetching.
- Integration with LLM (e.g., GPT-4o or Claude 3.5) for natural language understanding.

## 5. Success Metrics
- Average number of messages per user session.
- Successful intent recognition rate for core queries.
