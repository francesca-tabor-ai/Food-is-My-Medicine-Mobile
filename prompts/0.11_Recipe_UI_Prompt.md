# Vibe Engineering Prompt: Recipe UI (Supabase)

## Context
You are building the user interface for displaying recipes generated by the "Food is My Medicine" app. The UI needs to be clean, informative, and interactive.

## Instructions
- The `recipes` table (created for Feature 0.10) will serve as the data source for the Recipe UI.
- Ensure efficient querying of individual recipes by `id`.

## Backend Logic (Cursor Instructions)
1. **Recipe Retrieval API:** Create a Supabase Edge Function or a direct database query that fetches a single recipe by its `id`.
    - The query should return all fields: `title`, `ingredients`, `instructions`, `biomarker_benefits`, and `nutrients`.
2. **User Actions API:**
    - **Save Recipe:** Implement an API endpoint that allows a user to save a recipe. This could involve adding the `recipe_id` to a `saved_recipes` table, linked to the `user_id`.
    - **Add to Meal Plan:** Implement an API endpoint to associate a `recipe_id` with a specific `day` and `meal_type` in the `meal_plans` table.

## Vibe Guidelines
- The data retrieval should be fast to ensure a smooth user experience.
- The backend should provide clear, well-structured JSON responses that the frontend can easily consume.
- Ensure RLS is properly configured for `saved_recipes` and `meal_plans` tables so users can only manage their own data.
