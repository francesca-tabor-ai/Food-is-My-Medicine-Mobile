# PRD: Feature 4.1 & 4.2 — Grocery Ordering & Auto-Cart Integration

## 1. Introduction
This feature removes the final barrier to execution: getting the ingredients into the user's kitchen. By integrating with major grocery retailers, users can order their entire meal plan's ingredients with a single tap.

## 2. Goals
- Minimize the effort required to shop for healthy ingredients.
- Automate the creation of shopping carts based on meal plans.
- Provide a seamless "One-Tap" ordering experience.

## 3. Functional Requirements
### 3.1 Retailer Integration
- **Platform Support:** Connect with major retailers like Tesco, Amazon Fresh, and Whole Foods.
- **Authentication:** Securely handle user credentials or deep-link to the retailer's app/site.

### 3.2 Auto-Cart Creation
- **Ingredient Mapping:** Map recipe ingredients to specific product SKUs in the retailer's catalog.
- **Quantity Calculation:** Aggregate ingredients from multiple recipes and calculate the total quantity needed (e.g., 3 recipes needing 200g of spinach = 1 large bag).
- **Confirmation:** Allow users to review and edit the cart before final purchase.

## 4. Technical Constraints
- Requires integration with 3rd party grocery APIs (e.g., Whisk, Grocy, or direct retailer APIs).
- Handling of "out of stock" items and suggesting alternatives.

## 5. Success Metrics
- Conversion rate from "View Meal Plan" to "Order Ingredients."
- Average order value (AOV) through the app.
