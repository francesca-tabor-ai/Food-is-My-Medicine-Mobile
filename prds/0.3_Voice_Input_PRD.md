# PRD: Feature 0.3 — Voice Input

## 1. Introduction
Feature 0.3, Voice Input, enhances the primary conversational chatbot interface by allowing users to interact with the "Food is My Medicine" app using spoken language. This feature aims to provide a low-friction, natural interaction method, particularly useful for tasks like onboarding and daily coaching.

## 2. Goals
- Enable hands-free interaction with the chatbot.
- Improve user experience by offering an alternative input method.
- Facilitate quick and intuitive communication with the AI nutritionist.

## 3. Functional Requirements
### 3.1 User Interface
- **Microphone Button:** A clearly visible and accessible microphone button within the chat interface to initiate voice recording.
- **Visual Feedback:** Provide visual cues (e.g., waveform animation, recording indicator) to show that voice input is active and processing.

### 3.2 Speech-to-Text Conversion
- **Real-time Transcription:** Convert spoken language into text in near real-time.
- **Accuracy:** Ensure high accuracy in transcribing various accents and speech patterns.

## 4. Technical Constraints
- Integration with a robust Speech-to-Text (STT) API (e.g., Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, OpenAI Whisper).
- Efficient handling of audio streams to minimize latency.
- Privacy considerations for voice data processing.

## 5. Success Metrics
