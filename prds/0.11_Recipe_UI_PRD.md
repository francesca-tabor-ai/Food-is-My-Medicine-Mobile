# PRD: Feature 0.11 — Recipe UI

## 1. Introduction
The Recipe UI is the user-facing component for displaying generated recipes. It aims to present recipes in a clear, appealing, and actionable format, allowing users to easily follow instructions, understand nutritional benefits, and manage their favorite recipes.

## 2. Goals
- Provide an intuitive and visually engaging interface for recipes.
- Clearly communicate ingredients, preparation steps, and biomarker benefits.
- Enable users to save, regenerate, or add recipes to their meal plans.

## 3. Functional Requirements
### 3.1 Display Components
- **Recipe Image:** A prominent image of the prepared dish.
- **Ingredients List:** A clear, scannable list of ingredients with quantities.
- **Instructions:** Step-by-step preparation instructions.
- **Biomarker Benefits:** A concise explanation of how the recipe supports specific biomarker goals (e.g., "This recipe helps increase iron and Vitamin D.").

### 3.2 User Actions
- **Save Recipe:** Allow users to save recipes to a personal collection for future reference.
- **Regenerate Recipe:** Provide an option to generate a new recipe if the current one is not suitable.

## 4. Technical Constraints
- Frontend rendering of structured recipe data from the backend.
- Integration with image hosting for recipe visuals.

## 5. Success Metrics
- User engagement with recipe cards (e.g., saves, additions to meal plans).
- User satisfaction with the clarity and usability of the recipe display.
