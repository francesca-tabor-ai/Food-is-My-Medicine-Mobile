# PRD: Feature 0.8 — Supplement Recommendation Engine

## 1. Introduction
Building upon the biomarker interpretation, this feature provides optional, personalized supplement recommendations to users whose biomarker levels indicate a deficiency that could be addressed with supplementation.

## 2. Goals
- Offer targeted supplement suggestions based on individual biomarker data.
- Provide clear rationale and dosage guidance for recommended supplements.
- Empower users with additional tools to optimize their health.

## 3. Functional Requirements
### 3.1 Recommendation Logic
- **Biomarker-Driven:** Trigger recommendations when a biomarker is significantly below optimal or in a deficiency range.
- **Dosage Guidance:** Suggest a safe and effective dose range for each recommended supplement.
- **Rationale:** Explain *why* a particular supplement is recommended and its expected benefits.
- **Priority Scoring:** Assign a priority score to help users decide which supplements to consider first.

### 3.2 User Interface
- **Optional Display:** Recommendations should be presented as optional suggestions, not mandates.
- **Clear Information:** Display supplement name, suggested dosage, rationale, and priority score.

## 4. Technical Constraints
- Requires a comprehensive supplement knowledge base, potentially integrated with a third-party API or a curated internal database.
- Logic for cross-referencing biomarkers with supplements must be robust.

## 5. Success Metrics
- User engagement with supplement recommendations (e.g., clicks, saves).
- User feedback on the helpfulness and clarity of recommendations.
