# PRD: Feature 0.6 & 0.7 — Biomarker Interpretation & Ingredient Recommendation Engine

## 1. Introduction
This feature provides the "intelligence" that translates raw data into health insights. It compares user results against medical standards and suggests specific dietary changes to optimize health.

## 2. Goals
- Provide clear, non-alarmist explanations of lab results.
- Map specific biomarker deficiencies to actionable food recommendations.
- Personalize recommendations based on the user's age and sex.

## 3. Functional Requirements
### 3.1 Interpretation Logic
- **Range Comparison:** Compare user values against "Normal," "Optimal," and "Deficiency" ranges.
- **Contextual Explanation:** Generate text explaining what a specific level means (e.g., "Your Vitamin D is below optimal, which may affect immune function").

### 3.2 Recommendation Mapping
- **Biomarker to Ingredient:** Map specific markers to beneficial foods (e.g., Low Iron -> Red meat, spinach).
- **Avoidance Logic:** Identify foods that might hinder progress (e.g., Coffee blocking iron absorption).
- **Impact Scoring:** Each recommendation should have a strength rating or priority score.

## 4. Technical Constraints
- Requires a knowledge base or specialized prompt engineering for the AI to ensure medical accuracy.
- Logic should be executed in a backend service to maintain consistency.

## 5. Success Metrics
- User engagement with recommendation cards.
- Clarity rating of interpretations (via user feedback).
