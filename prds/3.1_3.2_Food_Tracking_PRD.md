# PRD: Feature 3.1 & 3.2 — Photo-Based Food Tracking

## 1. Introduction
This feature "closes the loop" by allowing users to log what they actually eat. By taking a photo of their meal, the system provides immediate feedback on how that meal supports their biomarker goals.

## 2. Goals
- Reduce the friction of food logging (no manual entry).
- Provide real-time "Biomarker Impact Feedback."
- Track adherence to the recommended meal plans.

## 3. Functional Requirements
### 3.1 Food Photo Capture
- **Image Recognition:** Identify ingredients and dish types from a photo.
- **Nutrient Estimation:** Estimate calories, macros, and key micronutrients (linked to biomarkers).

### 3.2 Impact Feedback
- **Real-time Insights:** Immediately tell the user if the meal helps their specific goals (e.g., "This meal supports Vitamin D improvement").
- **Adherence Tracking:** Log whether the meal was part of the suggested plan or an off-plan choice.

## 4. Technical Constraints
- Requires a Vision LLM (e.g., GPT-4o) for high-accuracy food identification.
- Integration with a nutrition database (e.g., Nutritionix, Edamam) or LLM-based estimation.

## 5. Success Metrics
- Daily active users (DAU) of the food tracking feature.
- Correlation between food tracking frequency and biomarker improvement.
