# PRD: Feature 2.1 & 2.2 — Biomarker Dashboard & Trend Graphs

## 1. Introduction
The Biomarker Dashboard is the visual home for a user's health journey. It transforms historical data into visual trends, allowing users to see the impact of their dietary changes over time.

## 2. Goals
- Provide a clear overview of current health status.
- Visualize progress through trend graphs.
- Encourage long-term retention by showing improvements in biomarkers.

## 3. Functional Requirements
### 3.1 Historical Tracking
- **Timeline View:** Store and display multiple lab tests over time.
- **Data Persistence:** Ensure all historical data points are accessible for comparison.

### 3.2 Trend Visualization
- **Biomarker Graphs:** Line charts showing levels over time (e.g., Vitamin D levels across 6 months).
- **Contextual Overlays:** Display "Optimal" and "Normal" ranges as horizontal bands on the graphs.
- **Improvement Indicators:** Visual cues (arrows, percentages) showing the trend direction.

## 4. Technical Constraints
- Frontend requires a charting library (e.g., Chart.js, Recharts, or Victory).
- Backend must efficiently query historical data points for a specific user and biomarker.

## 5. Success Metrics
- Frequency of dashboard views per user.
- User "stickiness" (retention) after uploading a second lab result.
