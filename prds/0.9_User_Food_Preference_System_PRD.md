# PRD: Feature 0.9 — User Food Preference System

## 1. Introduction
The User Food Preference System allows users to explicitly define their dietary likes, dislikes, and avoidance categories. This information is crucial for personalizing recipe and meal plan generation, ensuring that recommendations are not only nutritionally sound but also palatable and compliant with individual dietary needs.

## 2. Goals
- Enhance user satisfaction by tailoring food recommendations to individual tastes.
- Accommodate various dietary restrictions and preferences.
- Improve the relevance and acceptance of generated recipes and meal plans.

## 3. Functional Requirements
### 3.1 Preference Input
- **Like/Dislike Categories:** Users can specify ingredients or food types they like (e.g., chicken, eggs, salmon) and dislike (e.g., mushrooms, liver).
- **Avoidance Categories:** Users can select broader dietary restrictions or allergies (e.g., dairy, gluten, vegan, vegetarian, nuts).
- **Management Interface:** A dedicated section in the user profile or settings for managing these preferences, allowing for easy addition, removal, and modification.

### 3.2 Integration with Recommendation Engines
- **Filtering Logic:** The Recipe Generation Engine (Feature 0.10) must filter out recipes containing disliked ingredients or ingredients from avoidance categories.
- **Prioritization:** The Recipe Generation Engine should prioritize recipes containing liked ingredients when possible.

## 4. Technical Constraints
- Preferences need to be stored efficiently in the user's profile or a linked table.
- The filtering logic must be applied consistently across all food-related recommendation systems.

## 5. Success Metrics
- Percentage of users who actively set their food preferences.
- Reduction in user-rejected recipes due to disliked ingredients.
- User feedback on the relevance of food recommendations.
