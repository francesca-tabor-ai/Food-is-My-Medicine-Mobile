# Vibe Engineering Prompt: Voice Input (Supabase + STT)

## Context
You are integrating voice input into the "Food is My Medicine" chatbot. The goal is to make interaction as natural and effortless as possible.

## Instructions
- The frontend will capture audio and send it to a Speech-to-Text (STT) service.
- The transcribed text will then be sent to the existing chatbot backend (Supabase Edge Function).

## Backend Logic (Cursor Instructions)
1. **STT Integration:** The mobile app will use a client-side STT SDK (e.g., native iOS/Android STT, or a cloud-based API like Google Speech-to-Text).
2. **Text Forwarding:** The transcribed text should be sent to the same Supabase Edge Function that handles text-based chat messages.
3. **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for STT failures (e.g., 
displaying a "Could not understand" message to the user).

## Vibe Guidelines
- The voice interaction should feel responsive and natural, almost like talking to a human.
- Ensure privacy by not storing raw audio files unless explicitly consented by the user for improvement purposes.
- Provide clear visual feedback when the microphone is active and when the system is processing speech.
