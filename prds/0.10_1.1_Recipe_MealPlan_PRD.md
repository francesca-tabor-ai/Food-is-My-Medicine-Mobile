# PRD: Feature 0.10 & 1.1 — Recipe & Meal Plan Generator

## 1. Introduction
This feature moves the user from "knowing what to eat" to "knowing how to cook it." It generates personalized recipes and full meal plans (3 or 7 days) based on the user's biological needs and dietary preferences.

## 2. Goals
- Provide highly personalized recipes that address specific biomarker needs.
- Offer structured meal plans to reduce decision fatigue.
- Respect user preferences (likes/dislikes) and dietary constraints (e.g., gluten-free).

## 3. Functional Requirements
### 3.1 Recipe Generation
- **Dynamic Content:** Recipes must include ingredients, preparation steps, and a "nutritional impact explanation" (e.g., "This recipe helps increase iron").
- **Preference Filtering:** Exclude "disliked" ingredients and include "liked" ones where possible.
- **Constraints:** Adhere to dietary restrictions (Vegan, Keto, etc.) stored in the user profile.

### 3.2 Meal Plan Generation
- **Duration:** Support for 3-day and 7-day plans.
- **Meal Coverage:** Includes Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner.
- **Optimization:** The entire plan should be optimized for the user's top 2-3 biomarker priorities.

## 4. Technical Constraints
- Integration with an LLM for creative recipe generation.
- Database storage for saved recipes and active meal plans.

## 5. Success Metrics
- Percentage of users who save or "add to meal plan" a generated recipe.
- Retention rate of users who complete a 7-day meal plan.
